README FOR PROGRAMMING PROJECT 3

USAGE:

usage: simulator.py [-h] [-v]
                    fasta_sequence_file coverage read_length error_rate

Sequence Read Simulator. Written by Charles Eyermann and Sam Hinh for CS362
Winter 2016

positional arguments:
  fasta_sequence_file  The input file should be in FASTA format
  coverage             How many times the entire genome should be sequenced
  read_length          The length of each read generated
  error_rate           Error rate between 0 and 1

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose        Print out some more info about the program at runtime

  usage: assembler.py [-h] [-v] [-l] [-w] [-c] read_file kmer_length

  de Bruijn Graph-Driven Sequence Assembler. Written by Charles Eyermann and Sam
  Hinh for CS362 Winter 2016

  positional arguments:
    read_file           This should be the file containing your sequence reads
    kmer_length         Desired k-mer length (integer value).

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help          show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose       Print out some more info about the program at runtime
    -l, --logging       Write run information to log file
    -w, --weighted_dot  Output dot file with weighted edges instead of
                        unweighted edges. Cleaner end result.
    -c, --connected     First steps for solving eulerian superpath problem. Huge
                        hit to performance with large graphs. Enabling this
                        feature will find all unique eulerian paths and create a
                        list of subgraph objects.
